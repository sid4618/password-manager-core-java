# Password ðŸ”‘ Manager

College project in Core Java

## Simple Command line password manager 
* uses AES encryption along the way
* Though I claim it to be simple, it uses AES encryption
* In this core java project you will be able to:
  -  New User
  -  Login User
  -  Delete User
------------------------------------------------------
  After Successful login:
  -  Show All Passwords
  -  Add Password
  -  Get Password
  -  Generate New Password
  -  Logout
------------------------------------------------------
The idea behind this password manager is too manage passwords locally by creating files based on users.
Yes, the passwords are stored locally but they are hashed.
They are encrypted and decrypted using Salt <secret_key>
If you don't understand the encryption/decryption code make sure you watch some stuff about AES on youtube.

Also the delete user option is not working, if someone is interested you can do it as well
To get started just open the folder in Intellij Idea and make sure you add the dependency as well.
Cheers!
